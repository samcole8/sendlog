## Quick Start Guide

### Installation

This quick start installation guide is designed for Linux distributions running systemd.

1. Clone the repository. You can put it anywhere you wantâ€”`/opt` is recommended. Example:
   
   ```sh
   sudo git clone https://github.com/samcole8/sendlog.git /opt/sendlog
   ```

2. Configure a virtual environment and install Python dependencies

   ```sh
   python3 -m venv /opt/sendlog/venv
   source /opt/sendlog/venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r /opt/sendlog/requirements.txt
   ```

3. Copy the systemd service script into your systemd service directory, e.g.:
   ```sh
   sudo cp /opt/sendlog/pkg/sendlog.service /etc/systemd/system/sendlog.service
   ```
